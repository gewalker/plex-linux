This is a work in progress (duh!).

USEFUL INFORMATION:

These are the packages required to get the main configure script to run on Ubuntu 11.04:
build-essential autoconf autopoint libtool libboost1.46-all-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglew1.6-dev libmad0-dev libsamplerate0-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libbz2-dev liblzo2-dev libwavpack-dev libmpeg2-4-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfribidi-dev libsqlite3-dev libpng-dev libpcre3-dev libcdio-dev libmodplug-dev libfaad-dev libflac-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libjasper-dev libtiff4-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libenca-dev libxtst-dev libxmu-dev libxinerama-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libmicrohttpd-dev gawk cmake gperf nasm libiso9660-dev

extra stuff to be enabled in xbmc/plex:

libavahi-client-dev librtmp-dev libvdpau-dev libva-dev

libavahi stuff does not get enabled? don't know why yet and if it's needed anyway :)

yasm added as ffmpeg uses it to build asm code
nasm package should be checked if still needed. Might still be in use by plex code.
